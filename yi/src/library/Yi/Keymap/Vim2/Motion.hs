-- TODO:
-- from vim help:
--
-- Special case: "cw" and "cW" are treated like "ce" and "cE" if the cursor is
-- on a non-blank.  This is because "cw" is interpreted as change-word, and a
-- word does not include the following white space.  {Vi: "cw" when on a blank
-- followed by other blanks changes only the first blank; this is probably a
-- bug, because "dw" deletes all the blanks}
--
-- Another special case: When using the "w" motion in combination with an
-- operator and the last word moved over is at the end of a line, the end of
-- that word becomes the end of the operated text, not the first word in the
-- next line.
--
-- The original Vi implementation of "e" is buggy.  For example, the "e" command
-- will stop on the first character of a line if the previous line was empty.
-- But when you use "2e" this does not happen.  In Vim "ee" and "2e" are the
-- same, which is more logical.  However, this causes a small incompatibility
-- between Vi and Vim.
